I'm a self-taught software developer and *nix enthusiast. I love working
with a shell and spend most of my time in the terminal.

My favourite applications to write are CLI tools.

My favourite languages to write in are javascript and shell.

I'm currently focusing on web development, though I tend to be interested
in the low-level rather than the high.

In the future I look forward to learning [Go][1] and [C][2], as well as
improving my understanding of Unix and Linux.

For a selection of things that I've made / am working on, take a look at
my [repositories][2].

Other things that I like are Roger the dog, and going to the pub.
